# U.K-Road-Accident-Dashboard
This GitHub repository contains dashboard (pbit format) of United Kingdom's Road Accident data created with help of Power BI after analyzing with sql. To Download "pbit file" just click on "View raw". The dataset includes information on various aspects of accident, such as road conditions, type of vehicles, date, Sex of driver,age of driver , age of vehicle & etc. The goal of this project is to explore and gain insights from the data related to road accident and distribution across district. 
The data is sourced from https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data

In this analysis, I have used several data visualization techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset:

- **Slicers**: Slicers have been employed to filter and explore data district wise interactively.

- **Pie Charts**: Pie charts are used to represent the distribution of accident by sex of driver & accidnet scene attended by officer.

- **Donut Charts**: Donut charts offer a visual representation of the accident severity.

- **Column Charts**: Column charts are used to display trends and comparisons, such as the number of accidents by days , accident by age of vehicle involved in an accident.
  
- ** Vertical Column Charts** : Vertical Column Charts are used to display trends and comparison , such as accident as per speed of vehicles with accident severity,accident by light condition & accident by weather conditions.

- **Line Charts**: Line charts help in visualizing temporal trends and identifying patterns in accident data, such as Monthly variations.

- **KPIs**: Key Performance Indicators are employed to provide summary statistics and highlight essential metrics related to road accidents.
- **Treemap**: Treemap have been employed to visualize the accident by engine capacity (cc).
